# Churn_Prediction

This project is a personal training task to further understand classification problems and methods. The hypothesis is, as if I am a Data Scientist for a bank and have a task presented to me by my manager.

##Repo files
This repo contains:

- The notebook used to develop this project
- The dataset in csv format
- The requirements.txt for reproducibility
## Project
The Chief Retail Officer of the bank noticed a steady increase in the number of inactive users over the years which made her realize that the use of a data-driven solution is necessary to overcome the limitations of the current rule-based approach for monitoring user activity. Considering the nature of the data, you proposed to build a classification model that could accurately predict which customers are likely to turn inactive in the next 3 months.

## Task
Task:
Describe the approach you would take to provide a solution to the business.
Build a model capable to predict inactive users
Discuss how you would measure the effectiveness of your solution, and provide recommendations and insights for the business
